# PyPheperial

A program written in python for syncing all the Peripherals connected to computer using SDKs. Python Version 3.7
This project has an improved version called [AllPeripherals](https://github.com/gooday2die/AllPeripherals). I would like to suggest using [AllPeripherals](https://github.com/gooday2die/AllPeripherals) since it is better in terms of performance and efficiency. It supports all the features just like PyPheperial!

# Please check [AllPeripherals](https://github.com/gooday2die/AllPeripherals) For more information!


If you would like to continue using this program, please check [Old_README.md](https://github.com/gooday2die/PyPheperial/blob/PEP-8_version/Old_README.md) for original README file. Sorry for inconvenience.
