## Overview
This directory is for codes, just like it says it in the name.
I am currently revising my codes in order to make them neat and tidy. Otherwise, the codes would be spaghetti codes. 

All the functions and features could be seen in each README.md files.

## Informations

 - Wrappers Directory.
Everything related to SDK to Python porting should be updated there. 

- main.py
This is the main Python Script that would be needed to run the project. I would post some examples later I finish some more of low-level based work. 

- screenreactive.py
This is just a example of this Python script's usage. However, it is cool. So I decided to upload here, not in the sample directory. This script automatically captures your screen in some interval. By that captured screen, we run a clustering algorithm using Numpy and Scipy. By that clustering result, we get the most dominant colour of your screen. By that most dominant colour, we set all the LEDs in that colour for better experience. For example, when you set a Night Vision in CoD, you get Green LEDs from all your devices. Also, I would add some examples in a external file of example and installation. Remember, you must have Numpy, Scipy, MSS for this Python Script.
