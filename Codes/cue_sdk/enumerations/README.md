## Corsair ICUE LED Mappings
I found out that all the Corsair devices connected to ICUE can be simply controlled via their LED code, **regardless** of their type (Mice, Mousepad, Keyboard, HeadPhones).

Since Corsair did not gave us official mapping system for their devices, I found it in the dirty way; "Brute Force". I do know that it is dirty. However, It is clear known fact that the number of connected LEDs would not exceed 200. So it was pretty much worth it. This took a while for me to find it all by my hand. 

(I also borrowed mappings from the project [cue_sdk by 10se1ucgo](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/cue_sdk) however, a number of LEDs were missing and misplaced at least for me.) 

Took about 5 hours for me to find out all of these.
There might be missing LEDs since I do not possess them all by myself. So, please keep them in mind. Also, I have added a simple python script for you to find your own LED Mappings. If you have other types of Corsair Devices, and would like to help this project, please submit your LED Mappings to me. It would be a massive help.

If you would like to run this whole program, PyPheperial, you can just swap the enumerations file for your disposal. 

ex) if you use K95 RGB , you can just rename K95_RGB_PLAT.py into enumerations.py. Everything would work.

I am planning to make a auto support for this program, so you might not see this directory later in the future. 

If you would like to borrow these LED mappings for other projects, feel free to do so. I do not want anyone else to do this dirty work again.

## K95 RGB Mappings
**NOT K95 OLD Version With 18 Macro Keys.**
If you use that one, it is just fine for you to use normal enumerations file.

## Corsair Glaive Pro RGB
I am not quite sure that there is a LED in scroll wheel. 
Otherwise, my mouse is just broken.. :b

The left and right side LED bars are controlled at once.

## Void Pro RGB 
**This is wired model.** 
I am not sure about the wireless model.
There are two controllable LEDs in both Right and Left.
Mute button and Mic On and Off button is not controllable right now.
